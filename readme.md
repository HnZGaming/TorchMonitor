# Why you need Torch Monitor

Space Engineers is so complicated & poorly optimized that slight misconfiguration and/or a few player's activity can ruin everyone's experience. It's critical to monitor the server health and you need Torch Monitor for that, because the web-based dashboard will show you what's choking the server every given moment:

* Server ping
* RAM usage
* Profiling of each faction, player, grid, block
* Profiling of Havok physics
* and more

Space Engineers is a "competitive" game because the vanilla game is just a sandbox. To differenciate your server from the others it's essential to iterate your policies on solid data and you need Torch Monitor for that, because the time-series database will allow you to observe and analyze your population's pattern & growth:

* Number of online players (per faction)
* Total playtime of all players
* Countries/states of connected players (requires 3rd-party API authentication)
* and more

# How to get Torch Monitor

All of which is freeware, readily available for anyone who can sit through the setup.
